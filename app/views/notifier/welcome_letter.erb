Hey <%= @stampeder.firstname %>!

We're so excited that you're coming to STAMPEDE! By signing up online, you’ve save yourself a lot of time on the first night! Just tell the registration person your name and they’ll give your team and STAMPEDE bracelet. Make sure you leave your bracelet on for the entire week, since that’s how you’ll sign-in each night. 

STAMPEDE is even more fun when you bring your friends! And if you invite friends that don't attend McKinney, you can make sure they’re on the same team as you. There are two ways to do this. You can send them this link <%= sign_up_with_code_url(:host => "register.stampede10.com", :referral_code => @stampeder.referral_code) %> or give them your friend code, which is <%= @stampeder.referral_code %>.  They can type it into the “friend code” box when they sign up at stampede10.com.

If you do either one of those two steps, they will be guaranteed to be on your team. For every friend that you get to join your team and attend STAMPEDE, your team will get 10,000 points!  The team with the most points at the end of the week wins the STAMPEDE competition.

Thanks for signing up, now go invite all your friends to the most exciting event of 2010!
