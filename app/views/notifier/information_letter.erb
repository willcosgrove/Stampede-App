<%= @stampeder.firstname %> has just signed up to attend STAMPEDE, June 14-18 at McKinney Memorial Bible Church!

STAMPEDE is an event for students entering 6th-9th grade. They'll play games, eat snacks, worship with a live band and hear an incredible speaker.  Then we'll end the week with a trip to Hurricane Harbor on Friday, June 18. 

Thank you for allowing your student to be a part of the STAMPEDE experience! Be sure to visit http://stampede10.com to find more information and answers to frequently asked questions.
